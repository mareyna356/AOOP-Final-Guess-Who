# AOOP-Final-Guess-Who
My final exam for my Advanced Object Oriented Programming course during my 3rd semester at the Autonomous University of Baja California (August - December, 2019): a Guess Who with singleplayer and online multiplayer. Made in Java utilizing Swing, Threads, Sockets, and the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Requires the Server running to be able to play.
